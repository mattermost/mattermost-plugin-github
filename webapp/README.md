# README for Zoom

Add README information for the webapp portion of your plugin here.

## Template

Everything you need to build the webapp portion of your plugin is present in this directory.

### index.js

This is the entry point for your webapp plugin. Includes initialization code to handle registering your plugin with the Mattermost web and desktop apps. Use this file for additional set up or initialization.

### package.json

The minimum required dependencies will be added by default. Use this file for additional dependencies and npm targets as needed. This should be familiar if you have experience with npm, if not, [please take some time to learn about npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### components

The meat of your plugin will be the React components in this directory. You can find different directories and files depending on the components you chose to override. The default props that each component has access to are already defined. Use the `index.js` containers to supply new props and actions to the components as needed. Also include any child components you may need to build in this directory.

### client

Any web utilities you need to build for accessing different servers are added here. If you only need to access the existing Mattermost REST API, please use [mattermost-redux](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux), which is already included as a dependency. There should be a short example file to help illustrate the usage.

### actions

Your functions that affect the state of your plugins are in this directory. We recommend following [the pattern used in mattermost-redux](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux/blob/master/src/actions/users.js#L1253).

### webpack.config.js

Webpack is used to bundle the modules of your webapp plugin. Changes are typically not required.
